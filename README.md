# TitanTakedown
The version 2 of OpenMonsterHunter

I'm leaving Processing as a graphics librairy. I'm going for LWJGL for the OpenGL access.
Also I prefer having full control over the server. I was struggling with the interface in the tests..

Look forward to it ! I'm currently rebuilding everything I made in the old one...
